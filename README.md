# time and money
As a programmer, I want to bring myself a wealthy and leisurely life through my skills. The most basic need in life is food and clothing. However, after solving the problem of food and clothing, our life should be free and easy, rather than being stuck in one position like a screw, working nine to six every day, worrying about housing loans, car loans, raising children, and so on. I also don't want our children to grow up and become like screws. I hope to find some like-minded friends and give everyone a chance to change their current situation. Although I don't know where this project or opportunity is yet, we need to have a start first.
First, create this warehouse and organization. If you have good ideas, come up with them and try them together.

作为一名程序员，我想通过我的技术，给自己带来有钱有闲的生活。人生在世最基础的需求是温饱，然而在解决温饱之后我们的生活应该是自由自在的，而不是像一颗螺丝钉一样，钉在一个岗位，每天朝九晚六，每天为房贷、车贷、养孩子等发愁。也不希望我们孩子长大了也成为了一颗螺丝钉，希望通过找一些志同道合的朋友，大家一个机会改变自己的现状。虽然我暂时还不知道这个项目或者机会在哪，但是我们先要有一个开始。
先创建这个仓库和组织，大家有好的想法，提出来，一起去尝试。

## Have you ever thought of living a wealthy and leisurely life
- As a programmer, I want to bring myself a wealthy and leisurely life through my skills. The most basic need in life is food and clothing. However, after solving the problem of food and clothing, our life should be free and easy, rather than being stuck in one position like a screw, working nine to six every day, worrying about housing loans, car loans, raising children, and so on. I also don't want our children to grow up and become like screws. I hope to find some like-minded friends and give everyone a chance to change their current situation. Although I don't know where this project or opportunity is yet, we need to have a start first.
- First, create this warehouse and organization. If you have good ideas, come up with them and try them together.
